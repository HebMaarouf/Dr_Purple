This project aims to develop an integrated and effective application concerned with managing and improving the performance of a health center by providing an innovative technological solution that contributes to improving administrative processes and health services provided, by providing a comprehensive set of features and functions.
In this application, an advanced human resource management system is provided, where supervisors can record and track the information of doctors, nurses, and receptionists. The administration can also enter and update salary data, and make deductions and increases accurately and effectively.
In addition, the application provides an easy-to-use interface to manage the physical resources of the health center, and administrators can record and track medical equipment and supplies and manage inventory efficiently, which contributes to avoiding shortages and ensuring that resources are available when needed.
Thanks to the various reporting generation system, the management can use the statistical and financial data to make strategic decisions based on solid foundations.
The list of appointment reservations via the mobile application is an essential part of the application, where patients can choose and book their appointments according to the availability of doctors and services, and the application clearly displays the details of the appointment, including the name of the doctor, specialization and time.
For more interaction, patients can cancel appointments through the application and view the history of previous appointments, which provides greater flexibility for patients and contributes to improving their overall experience with the health center.
By using this application, it is expected to achieve a significant improvement in the management of the health center and the provision of health services, which contributes to improving health care provided to patients and enhancing efficiency and effectiveness in administrative operations.
